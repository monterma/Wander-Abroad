Semester Project

Project Statement

Studying and traveling abroad seems to be appealing for most young adults striving for enriching experiences. Schools and universities encourage traveling because of the impact it has on the individual to release prejudices by becoming more culturally educated. Experiencing other customs and ways of living forms attitudes and opinions better than textbooks and the Internet. Knowing all of the positive attributes of traveling, why donâ€™t more students and young adults take advantage of their freedom and explore the world? Currently it requires substantial research to discover important information like visas and documentation required, vaccinations and health suggestions, safety tips, law changes and social etiquette, money conversion, language barriers and even seasonal weather. Wander Abroad is an efficient application that can be reached by any device that can browse the Internet and therefore is available for anyone to use anywhere. This will enable travelers to tour with confidence, safety and provide the flexibility to change their travel plans on the fly without worrying about extensively researching what they will need to know before arriving at their destination.
